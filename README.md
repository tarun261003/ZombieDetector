Zombie Detector
Overview
This project involves developing a Zombie Detector using the Object Detection API and RetinaNet. The model has been fine-tuned with just 5 training images and achieves a remarkable 99.58% match with ground truth boxes, with a relative tolerance of 0.3. This demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning and data augmentation in object detection tasks.
